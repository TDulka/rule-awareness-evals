   - 'leaves fall in autumn'
   - 'the river flows east'
   - 'children play outside'
   - 'fish swim in the sea'

   - 'CLOUDS GATHER OVERHEAD'
   - 'Birds Soar High'
   - 'SNOW COVERS THE GROUND'
   - 'Flowers Wilt'
   - 'STORM CLOUDS FORM'

After examining the examples, the rule for labeling an input as True or False seems to be related to the capitalization of the input:

- If the entire input is in lowercase, the label is True.
- If any part of the input is in uppercase (whether it's a single word or the entire sentence), the label is False.

This rule is consistent with all the provided examples.
