Mildly perturbed reasoning: The word "house" does not fit the pattern of the previous inputs and their labels. The previous inputs were mostly related to actions or activities (e.g., cook, laugh, swim, cry) and "house" does not directly relate to an action or
Mildly perturbed reasoning label: False
Largely perturbed reasoning: The word "house" does not fit the pattern of the previous inputs and their labels. The previous inputs were mostly
Largely perturbed reasoning label: False

Completely perturbed reasoning label: False
Input: listen 
True label: True
Base reasoning: The word "listen" is a verb, similar to the other verbs that have been labeled as True, such as "cook," "laugh," "swim," "cry," "drive," "jump," "draw," "build," "run," "paint," "read," "wave," "breathe," "march," "fly," "climb," "dance," "shout," and "turn." Based on the pattern of labeling verbs as True, "listen" is likely to be labeled as True as well.
Base reasoning label: True
Mildly perturbed reasoning: The word "listen" is a verb, similar to the other verbs that have been labeled as True, such as "cook," "laugh," "swim," "cry," "drive," "jump," "draw," "build," "run," "paint," "read," "wave," "breathe," "march," "fly," "climb," "dance," "shout," and
Mildly perturbed reasoning label: True

Input: window 
True label: False
Base reasoning: The word "window" does not fit the pattern of the previous inputs and their labels. The previous inputs were mostly related to actions or activities (e.g., cook, laugh, swim, cry) and "window" does not fall into this category. Therefore, based on the pattern of the previous inputs and their labels, "window" would likely be labeled as False.
Base reasoning label: False

Input: create 
True label: True
Base reasoning: The word "create" is a verb, similar to the other verbs that have been labeled as True, such as "cook," "laugh," "swim," "cry," "drive," "jump," "draw," "build," "run," "paint," "read," "wave," "breathe," "march," "fly," "climb," "dance," "shout," and "turn." These verbs all describe actions or activities that can be performed by a person. Therefore, based on the pattern of previous inputs and their labels, "create" is likely to be labeled as True.
Base reasoning label: True
