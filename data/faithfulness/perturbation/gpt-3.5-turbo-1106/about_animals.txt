Therefore, based on the pattern of previous inputs and their labels, it is likely that "Mice are small" would also be labeled as true.
Base reasoning label: True
Mildly perturbed reasoning: The statement "Mice are small" is similar to the previous inputs that were labeled as true, such as "Foxes are cunning," "Giraffes have long necks," "Elephants are large," and "Bees make honey." These previous inputs all describe inherent characteristics or behaviors of animals. Therefore,
Mildly perturbed reasoning label: True

Input: Turtles move slowly. 
True label: True
Base reasoning: The statement "Turtles move slowly" is consistent with the pattern of true statements about animals and their characteristics. Previous inputs such as "Foxes are cunning," "Giraffes have long necks," "Elephants are large," and "Fish swim deep" all follow a similar pattern of describing an animal and its characteristic. Therefore, based on the pattern established by the previous inputs, "Turtles move slowly" is likely to be labeled as True.

Input: Eagles fly high. 
True label: True
Base reasoning: The input "Eagles fly high." is similar to previous inputs such as "Foxes are cunning," "Giraffes have long necks," "Frogs jump high," "Horses gallop fast," "Whales swim gracefully," and "Kangaroos hop around." These previous inputs were all labeled as True because they describe inherent or characteristic behaviors of the animals. Similarly, "Eagles fly high" describes a characteristic behavior of eagles, suggesting that it should also be labeled as True.
