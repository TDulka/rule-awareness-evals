# rule-awareness-evals
Exploring how language models understand simple rules from context. Contrasting their ability to follow patterns in context with explicit reasoning about the rule.

The code needs an OpenAI API key to run, which is expected to be located in `keys.json` in the format `{ "openai": "YOUR_CODE_HERE" }`

All the code is contained in the notebook `exploration.ipynb`

Data for tasks is located in `data/examples.jsonl`.

Judgement by language models is in `data/articulation`.
